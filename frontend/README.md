## Overview
This exercise is to implement the best possible solution to the exercises below in the time allotted. We're evaluating your ability to take a set of requirements and spike a holistic solution that demonstrates craftsmanship, thoughtfulness and good architectural design. This is **NOT** a test of how well you know Angular/React/Vue, nor should you try to impress us with overly clever and obtuse solutions. If you want to impress us, build something that is beautiful, intuitive and easy to debug/test/extend :smiley: .

Ideally your solution would have some way to run locally and test the results, so we can fully analyze your efforts.

### Unique chess
The goal of this exercise is to design a page which is responsive and follow the user story mentioned below

#### User Story: As a developer I want to

* Create form with the following inputs
    * Grid size (eg. 3x3,8x8, 2x3 etc)
    * Submit button
* Generate a grid with the inputs mentioned by the user
    * Each box in the grid should have random colors
    * Each box should have centered icons/images (Fontawesome, Material icons, etc)
* Actions for the user
    * The icons/images in the boxes should be draggable
    * Dropping the icon into other box should swap the icons/images
    * The icon/image should not go out of bounds
